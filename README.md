Hi Tailwind team!

I'm Martín, 36 years old, from Buenos Aires, Argentina. I was lucky enough to get a computer when I was a child and I took my first steps on programming very early in my life. Though, my first job was at tech support early in my 20s. It wasn't really fulfilling and I quit at around 25 to start freelancing doing websites.

I began as a back-end developer. I only knew *fors* and *ifs*, so working with anything visual was out of the question at that point. I found CodeIgniter which felt like a good option and I worked with it for a while. Looking for alternatives and new things to learn I found out about Laravel when version 3 was out. I honestly wasn't able to install it, but I kept trying and I've been happily working with it since version 4.

I got a project once where I needed to handle everything. The nature of the project asked for a one man show. The hot framework at that time was AngularJS which introduced me to the front-end world. I mean, it wasn't that I never touched JavaScript and I certainly enjoyed when I was able to solve something with jQuery, but this data-driven approach was a lot more enjoyable to me.

Another similar project came in, Angular derailed and with a bit more experience under my belt I looked again for options and I chose Vue for this one. This felt like home from the beginning.

While not a complete CSS ignorant I still relied on other libraries for the UI side of my projects. I used Bootstrap, Bulma, Vuetify... I once had the chance to introduce Tachyons in a project. I was able to make changes much more confidently and faster and while I felt constrained with e.g. the scale, this approach resonated with me a lot more.

Of course, when it was released, it took me very little time to understand that Tailwind was the missing piece for me to call me a full-stack developer. I was so excited about it that I started spreading the word about it everywhere I could. At this moment I'm working a full time job where we don't really use much of this, but I still was able to introduce Tailwind to my team :D

This was a bit long but what I wanted to show you is my eagerness to try and pick up new tools on my own. Over the years I became quite obsessed about the cleanliness of my work. This:

> Details matter to you, and if the text in a button is off-center by a pixel you will go to the end of the earth to figure out why.

Is exactly me. I remember a guy asked me once for feedback on his site and the first thing I see is a button next to an input which have border-radius off by a pixel. I couldn't believe my eyes!

Noblesse oblige and I don't mean to be obsequious with this, while I usually learn new things on my own, I certainly felt that I leveled up my game with Adam's courses. This is among the reasons why I think that working with the Tailwind team will be an immense step in my career. I expect to catch up with the team's pace of releasing awesome things and hopefully leave my imprint in a product that makes so many people's lives better.

I once wanted to write a Vue package to make a Tailwind prefix transparent:
```
<my-component class="tw-flex tw-items-center tw-justify-center"></my-component>

<my-component tailwind="flex items-center justify-center"></my-component>
```

Maybe not that much of a deal but I think it might reduce some friction when introducing Tailwind to an existing codebase. It's maybe a short and fun project to break the ice :D

I'm currently curious about Vite, I did a quick test and the speed of the HMR is impressive, it looks like a game changer. Pest also got my eye, I've yet to try it out but everything about it looks good. I also got a chance to give Elm a spin and I was amazed by the DX, I certainly would love to hack on it a bit.

That's all! 

Thanks,\
Martín
